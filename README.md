Climate Bind is an open-source, free-to-use peer-to-peer insurance web application offering insurance cover for damage to residential buildings caused by severe weather events.

Peer-to-peer insurance is where policyholders insure each other without an insurance company between them. This insurance model has its pluses and minuses, and our platform aims to maximise the benefits while reducing the disadvantages.

This type of insurance may better suit policyholders who cannot insure their property through traditional insurance, or where such insurance is expensive.

Our insurance service is free to use because we don't actually accept insurance premiums, and we don't pay them out. We merely act as a matching engine between those claiming and those insuring.

If two different policyholders insure each other, they each make a legally binding commitment to insure one another (up to the amount they themselves set). The higher the amount a policyholder can pay out to another, the higher the amount they can themselves claim.

We are currently in development, and we would love to hear from you if you are interested in insuring your home, if you are a web developer interested in working with us, or if you would like to financially sponsor the project.
